One of the best features of The SASÂ® Viya REST API is the ability to leverage the reportImages service to generate SVG images representing Visual Analytics Report(s).  This is particularly useful for programmers who are making updates to data that support reports and would like to get a quick view of how these changes are reflected.  

The SAS code in this folder can be run from a SAS Studio 5.1 (or later) session.  It will programtically call a Visual Analytics report and generate an SVG image from it.  More so, the SVG image is then presented in SAS Studio's results tab so the SAS developer can instantaly get a quick view of the report's current state.

Prerequesits:

* All code included in this folder must be submitted in a SAS Studio 5.1 (or later) session within a Viya 3.4 (or later) environment which contains the SAS Viya services that are being called. 
* The Visual Analytics Report's URI must be placed in the macro call at the bottom of the code
** example: %create_VA_svg_image(/reports/reports/9d9d1a82-1e39-4284-a278-c3a05388ea72)
* All of the report's data sources are have been lifted into memory as CAS Datasets
